## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
summary(cars)
cat("OUT DIR:", knitr::opts_knit$get("base.dir"))
```

```{callout plots}
#' ## Including Plots
#' 
#' You can also embed plots, for example:
#'
#' ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
cat("OUT DIR:", knitr::opts_knit$get("base.dir"))
plot(pressure)
#' ```
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
